# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 17th Frontend Mentor Coding Challlenge.

Frontend Mentor's coding challenges always help me get better at CSS designs, keeping in mind mobile-first design and making the webpage responsive across all devices. However, this challenge was also a good practice for JavaScript DOM manipulation skills and adding an Event Listener to the Submit button to take input from the user and display it afterwards.


**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
